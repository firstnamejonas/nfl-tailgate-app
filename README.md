## About

"tailgate." is a virtual fan experience for NFL fans. We all know it, the famous tailgating in front of the NFL teams' stadiums on game days. Fans meet, spend time together and talk about the teams, the game and much more. But obviously not every fan makes it to the stadium and that's why we built "tailgate." for these fans, so that fans who can't make it to the stadium can still interact with other fans online and be part of the community even if they are sitting alone in their living room.
